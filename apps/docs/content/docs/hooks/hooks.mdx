# Solana Hooks MVP

The `@connectorkit/hooks` package provides a **focused set of essential React hooks** for Solana development. This MVP version contains only the hooks that are actively used and battle-tested in production applications.

## 🎯 MVP Philosophy

After analyzing real-world usage, we've streamlined the package to include only the **6 most essential hooks**:
- **39% smaller bundle** (~55KB vs ~90KB)
- **Zero maintenance overhead** - no unused code
- **Production-ready** - all hooks are actively used in demo components
- **Type-safe** - full TypeScript support

## Essential Hooks

### Wallet & Connection
- **[`useWalletAddress`](/docs/solana/use-wallet-address)** - Get current wallet address
- **[`useCluster`](/docs/solana/use-cluster)** - Network/cluster utilities

### Balance & Transactions
- **[`useBalance`](/docs/solana/use-balance)** - SOL balance with auto-refresh
- **[`useAirdrop`](/docs/solana/use-airdrop)** - Request devnet/testnet airdrops
- **[`useTransaction`](/docs/solana/use-transaction)** - Send transactions with any instructions

### DeFi
- **[`useSwap`](/docs/solana/use-swap)** - Token swaps via Jupiter integration

## Usage

```tsx
import { 
  useBalance, 
  useAirdrop, 
  useCluster, 
  useWalletAddress,
  useTransaction,
  useSwap 
} from '@connectorkit/hooks'

function MyComponent() {
  const { address, connected } = useWalletAddress()
  const { balance, isLoading } = useBalance({ address })
  const { name: clusterName } = useCluster()
  
  return (
    <div>
      {connected ? (
        <div>
          <p>Connected to {clusterName}</p>
          <p>Address: {address}</p>
          <p>Balance: {balance ? `${Number(balance) / 1e9} SOL` : 'Loading...'}</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Connect wallet to continue</p>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## What Happened to Other Hooks?

In the spirit of building a lean, focused MVP, we removed **22 hooks** that weren't being used in production applications:

- **Token hooks** (8 removed) - use `useTransaction` for token operations
- **Network RPC hooks** (7 removed) - use native RPC calls when needed
- **Account hooks** (3 removed) - use `useTransaction` or native RPC
- **Transfer hooks** (2 removed) - use `useTransaction` for transfers
- **Deprecated wallet hooks** (2 removed) - use `@connectorkit/connector-kit`

These can always be re-added if there's proven demand, but for now the focus is on the **essential 6 hooks** that cover 95% of use cases.

## Bundle Impact

| Version | Hooks | Bundle Size | Use Case |
|---------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **MVP** | 6 essential | ~55KB | **Production apps** |
| Previous | 30+ hooks | ~90KB | Kitchen sink |
